Hi, I'm Marrit, a designer inspired by the American mid-west. With business chutzpah and enough code to be dangerous, I enjoy collaborating with purposeful people who care about their customers. Making with sketch and code and never facebook. Striving to produce work of the highest utility naturally results in work that is light, simple and progressive.
